This huge project is both the **last from 42's common core** but also the **first web project**.
It essentially consists in creating a single-page application showcasting a Pong game.

**The compulsory part includes**:
- the website must be secured
- as a single-page app, navigation only relies on back and forward arrows
- the project must be compiled using a single commandline launching a Docker container
- the basic POng game allows 2 players to play a match locally
- a player must able to launch a Tournamenent offering: a registration process and a matchmaking system for the matches 

The above rules can be enhanced and/or overruled by **adding specific modules**.
A list of major (1 pt) and minor modules (0.5pt) is provided in the subject.
In order to validate the project, **7 pts at least are required**. We chose to implement the following ones:

**Web modules:**
- Use a backend framework, namely Django (major)
- Use a frontend toolkit, namely Bootstrap (minor)
- use a backend database, namely PostgreSQL (minor)

**Users management modules:**
- Standard user mgmt, authentication and tournament players (major): adding registation, match history/stats, profile update, status update etc...
- Remote authentication (major): using 42 API

**Playability and user experience modules:**
- Remote players (major): play from different computers.

**Cyber-security modules:**
- Implement two-factor authentication and use JSON Web Tokens (major)

**Accessibility modules:**
- Web browsers compatibility (minor): Chrome and Firefox
- Multi-language support (minor): english, french and spanish

**Object-oriented modules:**
- Replace the basic Pong game by a server-side game, and implement an API (major)

This allowed us to to validate 8 pts and a 110/100 grade.
